## üìù Notes

> **Author Note**: Native "Search Files" was not working on my machine, so I created this as a temporary workaround that evolved into a comprehensive file navigation solution.

The extension leverages Everything CLI's powerful search capabilities, so in theory, every `es.exe` command-line argument for filtering should work through the search interface.
